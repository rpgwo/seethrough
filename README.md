## seethrough

Allow you to look through walls for 1-3 tiles. This is patched server-side for full look through and for light use (it is now server determine).  
For RPG Version 2+ only, incompatible with the Version 1.

### Installation

* Copy itemdef2.dat into the same folder.
* Run `python3 seethrough.py`
* You should see many write with hex offsets.
* Copy new itemdef2.dat back and start the client. You may want to set it to read only to not overwritten.
